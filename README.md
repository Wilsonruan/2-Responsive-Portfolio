# 2-Responsive-Portfolio

Responsive Portfolio is a practice website for utilizing Bootstrap components and grid systems. This website is a biography of myself. 

## NavBar

The three navbars are all linked to three individual html files.  The active page button is not disabled instead it will navigate back to the top of the web.  

## Responsive Layout and Image.

All three html file responses fit any size screen including mobile screen (horizontal and vertical). There are three links to social media and two links to webpage I developed. 

## Sticky Footer

Using Bootstrap only, the footer will appear on the screen no matter what the size is on the screen.
