## NavBar

The three navbars are all linked to three individual html files.  The active page button is not disabled instead it will navigate back to the top of the web.  Including links to LinkedIn and Github page. 

## Responsive Layout and Image.

All three html file responses fit any size screen including mobile screen (horizontal and vertical). There are three links to social media and two links to webpage I developed.
